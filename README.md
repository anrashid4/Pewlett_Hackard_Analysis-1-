# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
The number of employees which are retiring are 65427. The number of employees available for the mentorship role is 1549. One reccomendation I have for further analysis on this data is to see the relationship between retired employees and which department they work for. This can help in that it may show the company which department has the most amount of retired employees and they can then focus on rehiring individuals for that department prior to others.
